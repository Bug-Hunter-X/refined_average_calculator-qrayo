This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Python code related to calculating the average of a list of numbers. The original code has a flaw in handling cases with empty lists and lists containing zeros. The solution code provides a more robust and accurate implementation. The bug is demonstrated with example cases.  The solution involves explicitly checking for empty lists and handling potential division by zero errors.
